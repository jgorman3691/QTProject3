# QTProject3
A tutorial where I create a functional GUI window.  I have added at least one extra item to every category as a self-test

This is from the RealPython tutorial about creating menus, tool bars, and status bars to GUI windows.  This is actually my third or fourth tutorial series on GUIs,
the first ended with the Tetris clone, the second with a Calculator.  Here, I was aiming to rise a level, as I was becoming familiar with the syntax and
abilities of PyQt, and Qt in general.

Here, I tested myself at each step of the tutorial by using the skills of that lesson in an additional part of the program (or ten).  Particular examples are the 
menu bar itself, the status bar, and the status tips.

Unfortunately, I haven't gotten to the Icons section of the tutorial, as I couldn't find a resource for icons.  Please post links if you know where to find them.

Other than that, I will be uploading the rest of the tutorials and continuing on learning about low level Python networking, as it is EXTREMELY useful to be able to 
be able to create my own encrypted sockets, especially for inter-process communication.
